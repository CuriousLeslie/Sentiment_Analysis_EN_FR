Please beware of this Company,"I have only received one out of the two items ordered.
Reported it to customer services only to be told I had the blouse delivered, when I resent the code to the missing blouse, customer services are just ignoring me.
I am also having difficulty obtaining a returns labels from them as my computer security system will not connect to the returns section, saying it's unsafe and hackers can therefore steal data, I have explained this and requested a returns label be sent to my email address, yet again absolutely ignored.
Please be very careful with this Chinese Company, something is not right when computer software is indicating a unsafe site. Customer Services are not proving to be of ant help at all. Incidentally since dealing with them I am getting phone calls from someone speaking Chinese.","Please beware of this Company I have only received one out of the two items ordered.

"Lost Package, No Help from Shein","Shein’s customer service is disappointing. Two of my packages was marked as delivered, but I never received it. When I contacted support, they asked for proof—but how am I supposed to provide proof for something that was never delivered? What exactly am I supposed to prove?

Total Junk,"Just a fair warning to not waste your time and money.
I believe the reviews on the Shein website are bogus. It's impossible to have only 4-5 star reviews on everything listed on their website. Based on my 2 orders...
• Customer service is non-existent.
• The items I received all STINK like dead fish.
• By the time you place an order, have to make a return to get your refund, you're looking at least a month. There are many other options available in the U.S. to purchase quality items at a fair price without going to CHINA to get them.
• Everything I received looked so cheap it's embarrassing. You are mistaken if you don't think people can't tell the low-end Shein quality.","Total Junk Just a fair warning to not waste your time and money.

This review cost $90.,"For the most part, I have no issues with SHEIN. I usually order, the package is assigned to USPS or FedEx. When the package is delivered, I get an alert within 5 minutes that my package was delivered.

I currently have 2 orders, well now 3 orders open with SHEIN. One is going to be delivered with USPS. However I had a package that was allegedly delivered by Uni Uni. I got a notification at about 6:30pm that my package was delivered. The delivery person took 4 pictures. When I went to where the package was suppose to be, it wasn’t there. I immediately went to the SHEIN app. Checked the delivery. It says the package was delivered at about 4:30. So my package was outside for about 2 hours. Mind you I have a door that you can open and put the package where no one can see it. Or there is a 2nd level. The package could have been put there.
I ofcourse contacted SHEIN and they did their 7 day investigation. I just got a message letting me know that it is not their fault. That because Uni has it marked delivered. That that’s just it. No refund.
And see this is where consumers get the short end of the stick, because these are things that I actually want.
So I just went and reordered everything. Even went as far as to add the additional $13 for express shipping.

So once I finally get these 2 orders , I’ll probably be deleting the app. There are too many places to order from to be treated like this. There is no system in place to protect the consumer,

Also , UniUni just to show how unprepared they are..or maybe this is a part of their scam… when you go to their site to open a support ticket, you have to choose your location. I chose USA > NY . After NY the only 2 options are Albany and Buffalo. I live in Brookyn. This company isn’t prepared to handle these kind of issues. And as far as I see, where they delivered to isn’t where they should be delivering to. They do not have customer service to help.

And this is who SHEIN choose to use. Ok now I know, and I will make my appropriate decisions as a consumer.

Who knows maybe if I lived in Albany or Buffalo I would have been taken more seriously. 🤷🏽‍♀️

They kept saying the same without providing any proof.
As i can see, it is a fraud. They just lost one loyal customer besid the thousands who faced the same bad experience.

I am beyond disappointed with Shein’s…,"I am beyond disappointed with Shein’s dishonest business practices. When placing my order, nowhere did they clearly state that I would have to pay additional fees upon arrival in Tbilisi. They only informed me about it AFTER I had already made my payment and my order was processed! How is that fair?!

Not only that, but they failed to provide full details about these extra charges. They vaguely mentioned additional payments but never specified that I would have to pay 20 GEL for logistics fees, an 18% tax, and an outrageous 45 GEL Aramex service fee! It was written that it includes the delivery fees!!!!! If I had known all of this from the start, I would have thought twice before ordering.

This is completely unacceptable and misleading! I expected better from such a large company. Especially that I order at least every 1 week and I have many orders yet to but I won’t be ordering from Shein again and will strongly advise everyone to STAY AWAY unless they change their policies and start being honest with their customers.

YEARS of Loyalty – Now Completely Disrespected by SHEIN's Atrocious Customer Service,"I have been a loyal SHEIN customer for years, regularly placing large orders and recommending the brand to others. But after this latest experience, I am seriously reconsidering ever shopping with them again.

I placed a large order and waited patiently for it to arrive—only to receive the wrong package filled with swimsuits I never ordered. Mistakes happen, but how a company handles those mistakes says everything. And unfortunately, SHEIN has failed miserably.

I immediately reached out to customer service, hoping for a swift resolution. Instead, I was met with robotic, templated messages that repeat the same thing over and over—clearly not even acknowledging the actual problem. It’s beyond frustrating. Every time I reply, I have to wait another 24 hours to receive another copy-pasted, unhelpful response. It feels like they are deliberately wasting my time.

I was told to return the incorrect package at my own expense, even though it was their mistake. I went ahead and paid out of pocket, still trying to give them the benefit of the doubt. But now, after doing all the legwork for their error, I'm being told I have to wait another 25 days to receive the original order since returning their mistake. That means I'll be waiting more than 1.5 months for an order that was originally supposed to take 10 days. I should have gotten a reshipment right away! Not getting tortured for 10 days now!

No real apology. No compensation. No genuine help. Just a loop of scripted messages and blatant indifference.

This entire experience has been a nightmare. It’s made me feel completely disregarded as a customer. SHEIN clearly does not value long-term, loyal customers once they’ve got your money. Oh and they offered me 0.30 cents for my inconvenience! WOW Really!?!?

Save yourself the stress—there are plenty of other brands out there who actually care when they mess up and treat their customers with respect.

Absolutely disappointed. SHEIN, do better.","YEARS of Loyalty – Now Completely Disrespected by SHEIN's Atrocious Customer Service I have been a loyal SHEIN customer for years, regularly placing large orders and recommending the brand to others.

SCAMMERS,"Hi,
I purchased items from SHEIN on February 28th but never received a confirmation email with my purchase number.

Additionally, if the items are not satisfactory or if I need to track the delivery, I rely on having a purchase number or seeing the items recorded under ""Purchased items"" in my account. However, neither of these occurred.

I received text messages stating that delivery was attempted on March 8th, 9th, and 10th. When I inquired about my order ( almost impossible task without purchase number), SHEIN was finally able to locate my purchase and assured me that the items would arrive by March 19th. However, it is now March 25th, and I still have not received them.

I have tried to contact customer service by raising tickets, but they have now informed me that they will neither send my items nor issue a refund, claiming it has been over 30 days.

Firstly, it has not been over 30 days, as I purchased the items on February 28th.
Secondly, I was never provided with a reference or purchase number until I managed to submit a ticket. (It was nearly impossible to do so without a purchase number.) Once my order was finally located, they are now claiming it is past the refund deadline.

I would like your assistance in obtaining a full refund - £114.35 and possible compensation for the poor customer service I have experienced","SCAMMERS Hi,

It was the worst shopping experience…,"It was the worst shopping experience I've ever had. My last purchase was about 27 items, of which I only received 9. No matter how many times I emailed and said that my order hadn't been received, they kept telling us to send them your order in full and there was nothing we could do. This is irresponsibility, and they are only looking for sales and no service or warranty. There is no shipping.
In response to Shine response
Now shein reply and said, ""Please send a message... 🤣‌ I did all of these. I also called FedEx and they said, 'The sender should be responsive. We will send whatever they send to us.' My package wasnt damage and unpacked and sealed, so they sent my order incomplete. 27 items in my order, while the box weighed 1.9 kilos. This makes sense to me, but Shine doesn't accept it.","It was the worst shopping experience… It was the worst shopping experience I've ever had.

Incorrect price charged at the checkout,"I have been shopping with Shein for 5yrs now, most of their stuff are ok. In my recent shopping, I realised they showed a low price while I browsed the item as it was on sale at the check-out, the price went up when a coupon is applied. I reported to their customer service that this is not fair. If i browse an item for less at the check-out time it should atleast show that price which i saw first even if no coupon applied. In my case, after using the coupon the price went up. Their customer service is so adamant that they are not ready to refund the excess amount charge and not accepting that this is an unethical practice that you show a low price while browsing and charge more at the check-out. They used to be good in resolving such issues, so i am surprised now even when their unethical practice has been called out they are refusing to accept and return the excess amount.
Answer to your response: i have already raised a ticket and repeatedly your customer service is not agreeing to refund the excess amt you charge, they are not understanding the point that this is a unfair practice to show less price while browsing and charge more while check-out, even if I apply coupon the price should not go up it should go down or remain same if coupon don't apply on that item, which is also strange. Coupon is a discount so it should apply to all items in the check-out. They are suggesting to return the item if i don't like, that's isn't the point. Point is the misleading pricing. Hope you can get this sorted, you have my order no you can see the ticket related to it. I can't reply to your response hence adding here.","Incorrect price charged at the checkout I have been shopping with Shein for 5yrs now, most of their stuff are ok.

Garbage,"Garbage. Looked at some stuff and they promptly charged my bank over $300 for 2 “orders” that don’t I never purchased, they don’t have a record of, and now have to replace my card.

I’ll pay more for American made, but it will be quality and at least they don’t sell my info, hate us, and have some respect and values.
Your reply is noted. I recommend YOU try to file any kind of complaint. Basically your company sold my information or used it for your own purposes simply because I browsed your site. And what, if any, action could I take against a state run government? And I was mistaken. You’ve tried to rob me of over $500 now. 3 separate purchases that don’t even show up, no email sent, no nothing. Your company is a front for information mining and exploitation. There is no negotiating with evil.","Garbage Garbage.

Complaint,"I know this is not the site to explain my experience, but I could not find any other.

I registered as a agent for Shein.
1. The agent told me to deposit R100, I will get a R60 joining bonus, I did my first order, successful, I received R190.
2. They told me to deposit R550, which I did, I will do 4 tasks and receive R2300.......don't believe it, after I did 3 tasks they said I must deposit a further R2000 to be able to complete the 4th task. Well for somebody who is unemployed, where must I get that kind of money.

No the account is frozen, I can't get my R550 back and they just say its the system, it will not refund.

i am so sad to report,"i am so sad to report, that after so many years fo being a trusted buyer of this retailer... that they have changed for the worse.

they have started only giving a 50% refund for products that do not match the description in the listing.
they are denying to refund me 16$ on a product that does not look like the pictures. doesnt matter how many times i have sent photos that clearly show the diffirence and they only offer me to return for the refund and are taking nearly 5$ for a return fee.
i am shocked.

not only do they keep doing this but they sold me an electronic device for nearly 40$, that does not do what it is supposed to.
the item has illegal and stolen content on it (it is a tv box) and they did not offer to give me a refund right away after plenty of evidence.

they have been waisting my time endlessly due to the time difference. i have to wait 24 hours for one response, that leads to many more, since they are trying so hard to keep the money, instead of trying to keep a trusted customer.

im intensely questioning ordering again and im actually very sad about it. i loved shopping there. but since my money is not any longer safe, i am not confident in ordering there again.

i could easily be helping them to avoid making the same mistake so they can change the info but this is wrong. and this is not fair.","i am so sad to report i am so sad to report, that after so many years fo being a trusted buyer of this retailer... that they have changed for the worse.

Disappointed that SHEIN have not…,"Disappointed that SHEIN have not acknowledged that the parcel was not delivered. Yodel took a photo of the a package outside somewhere and this was not outside my home.
I have had feedback from SHEIN that I should check with neighbours and no refund can be given, even when I already told them that I had checked everywhere - the package included £42 of goods and was towards my child’s 12th birthday presents

Update following the response:
I have used the link and not had any response other than that I can get a refund even though the goods were not delivered. Yodel have redirected myself to SHEIN for the 4th time!! It all seems like a scam to me. It might just be £42 but if SHEIN are doing this regular as the reviews would suggest, then for every 10 paying customers of £40 they’re getting £400, 100 customers is £4000, somebody somewhere is making a profit!! Meanwhile my daughter and many other customers do not receive the goods they have paid for with hard earned cash!!
Extremely disappointed that there is no customer service number. -only the generic link that in itself suggests it is a robot!!","Disappointed that SHEIN have not… Disappointed that SHEIN have not acknowledged that the parcel was not delivered.

I had an item arrive and the glitter had cracked open and covered the entire contents of the package with the glitter. There was also a small tear in the bag so it had also leaked out all over the outer packaging bag, When I tipped the contents out as you can imagine it went everywhere and I was not happy

I sent Shein a picture showing the item and also another id ordered of how it should have looked, I asked them to either send me out a replacement or give me a credit so I could order another 1 with my next purchase

I was told... To verify and locate the specific problem, we need to conduct a detailed inspection of the goods with quality issues. We hope that you can return the goods reported, and we will provide you with a free return service. (what is there to evaluate? a vial of glitter has broken and gone everywhere. the end. I tried 3 times to get them to listen as its all well and good saying its free to return BUT my time is NOT free, My travel costs are NOT free and this is for less than £2.50 its not worth the hassle or the damage to the planet to send it all the way back to China where it will just be binned anyway

I find this policy totally moronic frankly

I'm sick of things arriving damaged, bits missing, poor quality but you just suck it up as there is no point complaining, they make it as hard as possible with a 10 step process going on the bot, explaining the issue, selecting the order, filling in forms, selecting the product, uploading pics of the packaging, bar code, item you have issues with and then when they get back to you they expect you to send it all the way back to China WTF is the point for a couple of quid, So you have won I won't be sending it back and I've lost £2 on something I now can't use and had the room covered in glitter

Update,"Final update 3/22: After one month, I finally received the final order. I found a wonderful seamstress who did an amazing job altering the medium shirts to small.

What a joke! Nope. Shein has no intention nor intellect resolve these issues. And based on other reviews, I don't dare return the items for a refund that I will never receive.
Say what you will about Amazon. It's an American company. Another update: one order arrived today with 6 pretty shirts. I am petite. 115 pounds. I ordered all smalls. They are all mediums. Huge. Done with Shein. Period. Update. Ordered 11 shirts 4 packages on February 22. 2 came USPS March 3. The other 2 with 8 shirts STILL have not been delivered. UniUni are staffed with liars, most are foreigners who have hung up on me. On the first ""failed attempt/wrong address"" I called and confirmed, even though USPS got it right. Then, over and over and over. ""Failed delivery/inaccessible"". COW MANURE. I am retired. Home all day. No one has ever come and no one has ever called.

Charged card but need payment verification twice,"UPDATE: Thankfully, Iwas refunded the entire amount.

I made multiple purchases with Shein recently. When checking the statuses for them I noticed they wanted ""payment verification documentation"" of all of my transactions, meaning they wanted screenshots of the online statements regarding the transactions. I was ok initially with it since I made multiple purchases (7 transactions), and spent over 300 dollars. After sending in the the proof, 2 days later it got denied and wanted me to resend more proof. Totally inconvenient at this point. They were QUICK to charge my husband's card, but now I have to provide proof AGAIN! And the way they show their orders online (all items individually with their own order number), it's too difficult to know which transaction belongs to the order. I've requested to cancel all of my purchases instead. I've never had to do this for any online store. I was looking forward to getting these items for me, my baby girl, and son for upcoming trips we have planned in the next 3 months.","Charged card but need payment verification twice UPDATE: Thankfully, Iwas refunded the entire amount.

"Shein – Unreliable, Unprofessional, and Disrespectful Service","I placed an order from Shein, but despite the tracking system showing it as ""delivered,"" I never received my package. I immediately contacted customer service, expecting assistance in resolving the issue. Instead, they refused to issue a refund or offer a replacement, leaving me with no product and lost money.

This is extremely frustrating and completely unacceptable. A company that fails to take responsibility for missing orders is not trustworthy.

Shein slow,"I am in need of a reminder of what Shein is about. I look on Shein for some deals on drones, socks, and some types of hoodies. But every time I go on Shein, it takes like 2 minutes to load. This might be because of my old phone, but I think Shein could benefit from all this excess resource taking. I also almost always get women's recommendations the moment I open Shein, why not add a little variety to your landing? This seems pretty centered around one group.

Overall Bad Experiences Lately,"Haven't had a good experience lately. I used to love Shein and would shop there often. But my last order was such a pain to get any help with. To even initiate an exchange took me a week. The constant emailing back and forth to get some kind of answer. Then they finally emailed me a return label. Waited forever for it to get shipped back and a new order placed. My new order finally arrived well over 10 days late and they offered nothing for all of the inconvenience. I decided at this point to just return the exchanged order. Of course I can't simply initiated a return on my end. For some reason labels aren't being generated anymore and it's all QR codes. I don't have a UPS store remotely close to take it in to be scanned so I need a physical label. So, more back and forth emails to try to get a label sent to me. It is just not worth the hassle to save a few dollars. I won't be shopping at Shein anymore. To update my review to the response: I already have an open ticket that I have been dealing with for weeks. I finally got a printable return label. Nothing was ever offered for my inconveniences. Submitting yet another ticket is not going to change anything. 3-3-25: I was checking my return record and noticed I was charged for my return!! So I am getting refunded nothing for this order. I originally placed this order back on 1-16-25. After all the back and forth communication and waiting on my exchanged order that showed up over 10 days late, I am being charged to return it?! I would have just kept the order if I would have known. This was not expressed to me during my communications and when a label was sent to me to return the items. Just AWFUL communication and customer service all around.","Overall Bad Experiences Lately Haven't had a good experience lately. I used to love Shein and would shop there often.

What an awful company to deal with,"What an awful company to deal with. Made the order and paid for it. Next day there was an email from them asking for some reason for me to go through a verification process. The link for this asked me for my telephone number, but then told me it was not recognised, even though it matched the number I had used to set up the account. The idea of contacting someone for help was laughable...they only have a bot. Eventually worked out that they wanted a screenshot of the online bank transaction- just another inconvenience. The whole thing has taken two hours out of a busy day, and now I have to spend time writing this to dissuade anyone from using them if you have any other alternative at all. To top it off, they say it will take two days to process the verification,,, so the items will not be despatched until 4 days after the order, and they send by snail mail anyway (6-8 days to be delivered on top of the 4 day delay.

SHEIN Uses SpeedX to Deliver; They Steal Packages,"I ordered over 13 items from Shein. The Logistics companies they use are SpeedX or OnTrac.

Dishonesty,"I ordered a number of items on 20th January (Order - GSO1M2493000N33). Even before the initial delivery Shein sent delivery failure notifications. The order was split into two deliveries. I received all but one item with Royal Mail tracking number OR596559716GB. The item was not at the delivery collection centre as of Saturday 22nd February- ridiculous. Before that, I had received several conflicting messages regarding the status of the delivery and have evidence to the effect.

Shipping issues you WONT get your money back,"I have ordered numerous times with no issues till recently. I ordered a pair of boots for about $31 dollars. It was marked delivered however, nothing showed up to my house or PO box. I have checked numerous times with the post office and neighbors to see if anyone has received them and nothing has come up. Shein refuses to refund my money or send me another pair of boots. All they keep doing is apologizing. So me the customer is out money and boots and they do not care! I have NEVER had issues with any other company with shipping issues, they have always jumped on it to make it right but NOT Shein. I just want to let others know that they will not make it right. If it says delivered and you don't get it, you're out money and product. Just be aware. It has been reported to the BBB too.

***ALSO note, I have been going back and forth with Shein customer service since about the beginning of February since apparently there was a delay in shipping and then it says delivered and I never got it, and all they offer is an apology, no offer of refund or sending the product again.

Sizing is Way Off,"Their sizing is way off on their guides. Rather than just ordering the size I am, which is an XL, I used their provided size guides, using the measurements they showed, which had me ordering 2XL to 4XL depending on the item. I was skeptical, but that is what the guides said and they say to use their measurements for accuracy. Yet again, everything I received was HUGE! The only thing true to size that I have ever ordered from Shein has been their bras.

My issue with this last order is two-fold. First, I leave on vacation next week, so, while I can return most of the items for a refund, I now have no new clothes for my trip because a re-order will not arrive in time. Thanks for that Shein!

Second, one of the items ordered was a bathing suit, and those are non-returnable. It is so long it looks like a dress and the extra fabric bunches along the chest area. It looks terrible and is unwearable, so it will end up in the thrift store bin, which is essentially like throwing money in the garbage. Everyone else accepts returns of swimwear as long as the hygiene strip is still in place... Amazon, Walmart, local clothing stores...but not Shein. This is an extremely unfair return policy, especially given the inaccuracies of their sizing.

This will be my last order from Shein.

You can also tell how terrible their customer service is by their responses on this site. They don't address customer concerns. They use the same copy and pasted generic response telling people to talk to their chat bot or open a ticket. Their chat bot is useless, sending you in circles without answering your questions, and, even if you do open a ticket, you still just get what is basically a chat bot, generic, copy and pasted response back saying they can't/won't help you. Overall, just a horrible company to deal with that doesn't care about customer service.","Sizing is Way Off Their sizing is way off on their guides.

Yh the items are cheap but it’s not worth this hassle at all. Must say other clothes companies are much much more understanding and helpful.
And SHEIN will now respond with their generic response to contact them… been doing that for the past 2.5 weeks and nothing!!!!!

Shein's Business Practices: Robbery and Disrespect,"My first Shein order was the absolute worst customer experience of my life. I ordered a small dresser. What arrived was a completely different piece of furniture, addressed to a stranger who has never lived at my address, with no Shein branding on the label.

Unbelievably, Shein customer service told me to open the package (why?! The label clearly described a different item!), assemble it to confirm it wasn't my dresser (seriously?!), then disassemble (does any of this make sense?), repack, and carry this heavy, wrongly shipped item to a UPS office that is not very close to my house. I have medical restrictions preventing me from lifting or carrying heavy objects. Even if I could, why should I be inconvenienced for their mistake, especially when the package wasn't even addressed to me?! They should arrange pickup of their error.

Instead, Shein issued an ultimatum: if I don't lug this heavy, misaddressed item to UPS, they won't ship my actual order or refund my money. Their customer service's response to my legitimate complaint was a complete mockery. They basically stole my money and refused to ship my order.

Since SHEIN wants to make me wait 24hrs…,"Since SHEIN wants to make me wait 24hrs when I have just been done so wrong by this company. I’ll leave a review here. I made the mistake of choosing SHEIN as the place to buy majority of me and my husbands vacation clothes for a cruise where we will be celebrating our 9 year anniversary. Our pool lounging clothes, swim suits jewelry, elegant night clothing, my husbands clothing everything. I purchased all these clothes on the 2-4-25. The arrival date for our clothes was supposed to be delivered between 2-7/2-2-14. This delivery date worked for us. I figured since 4/7 was the earliest there should be no issues. That was until a few days later I saw SHEIN put my entire order on hold. I couldn’t believe it. I went to reach out on live chat but there was no one available to which I was instructed to leave a ticket. I filed out the ticket and after 24hr no response. So I went on social media and saw other people were having the same issue with SHEIN and their entire order was frozen. From what I saw people said the best option is to monitor your tracking and if anything changes to reach out to SHEIN again. Which i did and I didn’t see any changes in fact until yesterday morning I was surprised to see my order had been shipped and my delivery date would be 4-14 through usps. I thought great it will all work out

Today I woke up to see that all went out the window. Today my order is saying it will be delivered by fed ex- on 2-18. For 1 I choose priority shipping with SHEIN because it was available to me because I spent so much money. I know fed ex is one of the worst delivery services in the game I never go through companies that use fed ex because they are so slow at deliveries or I just won’t choose a delivery option with fed ex. 2 my cruise is on the 15th and my husband and I will not be able to receive our package because we will be in the middle of the ocean. I’m so upset this is the second company to do this to me and with my cruise being 3 days away you have really made my life difficult. Advertising product you know you won’t be able to sell at least not at the time people buy it and that is beyond unethical. I will be filling a claim with my bank I don’t know what I’m going to do about my clothes but SHEIN idk what your gonna do about your set backs","Since SHEIN wants to make me wait 24hrs… Since SHEIN wants to make me wait 24hrs when I have just been done so wrong by this company.

Bought and paid for an item that never arrived,"Bought and paid for a Compost Bin, they sent me tracking for someone else's package, which was delivered to that person, not to me. When I reported this, they refused to refund my money, and I've never received the compost bin I ordered.

Just a bunch of scammers.

Contacted what they call ""support"", was basically told 'tough shit, the package was delivered"", even though I never received it. Of course they provided the wrong tracking number to begin with, so I'm sure that package was delivered to whomever ordered it. And they won't provide the actual tracking information, only that it was signed for by someone other than myself.

5 Months To Get My Money Back on Very Poor Quality Boots,"I had some boots delivered in early August 2024 and within 2 months the soles had worn right over on the side and the rest were flaking away. They were a DM style lace-up boots with thick soles and heels. I took them to be reheeled at a shop and was told that the soles were made of some cheap foam, so could not be repaired.

I contacted Shein first on 30 Augustr 2024 and sent photos to which they agreed to refund me and said I did not need to send the boots back. They failed to refund me. It took 9 separate times for me to contact them online chat to get a refund. Each time I contacted them they would ask me to send photos all over again and would take days to reply to me. Then they would close down the chat sessions, not allowing me to reply!

They would also tell me that I had already had a refund for the boots, when I had not. I had a refund in early August 2024 for a top that came in the same order as the boots, but was a cheaper price than the boots. This refund I received before I made my first complaint about the boots!

I asked for their legal department address so that I could take them to court as they had gone back on what they had put in writing online chat that they would refund me in the Sept. I sent them the photos 3 separate times. I refused to keep sending more photos to them and they said they would not refund me unless I sent them again.

It appears that no one you chat to in customer services can see any past messages between previous online chats even though you can see them all on your account. Nor can they see previously what was agreed or what photos I sent. Once they shut down the conversation, you have not option but to contact their online chat again to go through the whole process again.

You cannot contact them other than through the online chat and even initially it is a Bot you speak to, so is hard to even speak to anyone online.

The most appalling quality boots ever and the worst customer service I've ever received in my life from any company. I got the impression that they hoped I would give up trying, so they would not have to give me a refund.

5 months to get my money back and all they offered in compensation was some points on my account! I will never buy from Shein ever again. Avoid.","5 Months To Get My Money Back on Very Poor Quality Boots I had some boots delivered in early August 2024 and within 2 months the soles had worn right over on the side and the rest were flaking away.

Discriminatory Practices,"There’s some weird discriminatory practices going on.

A long time shopper has been blacklisted from raising complaints and requesting assistance regarding failure of services; random out of stock after purchases, random banning from leading reviews without giving a reason or even just a temporary ban, lies about lifting said temporary ban.

But a wholly new shopper, who almost got scammed by a third party seller hosted by SHEIN, immediately gets attention. In fact, new shopper requested help for old longtime shopper.

New shopper was promised assistance to old shopper.

Old shopper remains banned. Old shopper keeps asking for help but everyone cancels their help requests. What sort of wild prejudice is going on here? SHEIN owes old reviewer almost $100 dollars worth of points. Points that would’ve been received after item reviews. Item reviews which the old shopper is BANNED FROM LEAVING. BANNED WITHOUT PROPER REASON. BANNED WITHOUT PROPER WARNINGS.

I am the old shopper. I remain banned. My family member is the new shopper. What the heck. Can you just un-blacklist me? Terrible. I have no platform to speak for assistance, I don’t even know how to appeal because of the blacklist.

Terrible customer service leading to…,"Terrible customer service leading to complete lack of confidence in their business practices.

I bought several dresses for an upcoming wedding. The dresses did not fit. Some had very low quality. Trying them on left me with a rash on my arms for a week. But whatever… I could return them, right?

I followed all return policy requirements: the dresses were not worn, not washed, not damaged and the tags were still intact and on each.

I received an email to say that 1 of the dresses was being returned to me (with a $20 shipping charge) as it did not meet the return requirements.

I contacted customer service to ask what the issue was. They replied with the policy. I’m contacted again to ask what specifically was the issue. They replied again to say the couldn’t say and sent the return policy. I contacted a third time, and received the same message.

So you will refuse a refund, but can’t justify why?

I’ve gotten the item back, and for the life of me, cannot understand why the return was refused. And “SIENNA” from customer service can’t even explain why.

Their policy is completely arbitrary and customers are at their whim!! Absolutely ridiculous. Atrocious customer service. And from an online clothing company… one should be able to expect that they can try something on and return if needed! But not at SHEIN.

SHEIN review,"I recently ordered a few items from SHEIN.
First, the prices are amazing—I snagged some super cute dresses for really low prices. However, the sizing was tricky. I ordered a size up based on reviews, but one dress was still too tight!
The quality was also hit or miss. Some pieces looked and felt great, while others were a bit flimsy. I had an issue with one item and tried to contact customer service, but they weren't very helpful.
Overall, SHEIN has some great finds if you're willing to take the risk. Just be sure to read reviews and double-check the sizing! Would I shop there again? Maybe, but I'll be more cautious next time!","SHEIN review I recently ordered a few items from SHEIN.

Cheap low-quality clothes,"Shipping - super fast and cheap

My lesson learnt is not to buy clothes from Shein because I'd not want to wear it or wear it a couple of times and then send it to recycle. Unless I am a student or someone who wants to look low-budget. You get the gist.","Cheap low-quality clothes Shipping - super fast and cheap

Buyer beware..,"After receiving an item that was clearly not what was pictured on their website. I sent them 3 photos of the item which was supposed to be a tufted cat pillow that was pictured with front to back faux fur and was also tufted. What I received was a flat piece of faux fur fabric, not even front to back, but on the backside, was rubber like a rug. It was flat, it was basically a rug, no tufting or anything. I found out it was a non returnable item. That is why I reached out to Shein, to get my money back. Sending them photos of what I received front to back and the answer I got back was there was no clear way to tell that this was not the same item that was in the photo!! I was totally shocked. After this, I will not be purchasing from them again. I proceeded to return my other items and my daughter did the same with hers. Before, I used to enjoy shopping from them. But now knowing that they do not stand behind their products, in fact, protect sellers and also may I say they removed my review from the itm warning others complete with removing my phots to show whatwill actuall arive underneath this item AND removed the item from my purchase list so I can't even see it anymore but did not return my money!! So basically, under my name where I can look at my purchases. This item has been removed, but yet they have kept my money! No I do not recommend this site to anyone! Buyer bewareIf it's too cheap to believe, don't believe it! Part of this review asks for your order number for the item. Unfortunately I can't look that up because sheen remove the item from my purchase list! I am going to try to find it another way. So hopefully I will be able to post this. Maybe I have it still in in email.If so I will add it to this and I will be able to actually post this review.
Update 2/3/25
In regards to Shein's response below I have already followed those steps. And as I stayed it, even when I sent them, photographs stated that they saw no difference between the tufted pillows that was shown on their website and the flat singe fabric mat that I was sent. So there is no need for me to contact their customer service. As this is what i've already done and received my answer from them.","Buyer beware..

I was charged £40 on top of the order…,"I was charged £40 on top of the order despite having paid the £5 membership fee before making my order which was supposed to save me this extra ""handling charge"". Despite I having written to customer service regarding this matter they have not bothered to respond to me or refund me this unreasonable surcharge that they have taken from me.

Also, there was no clear invoice sent to me with the price of each of the goods and only pictures of the goods.

I have made 3 separate orders but only see one on my account. They didn't forget to take the money from my account though!

There is no clear instructions on how to return clothing which doesn't fit. And also I'm unclear if I am expected to pay to post them back to a UK address or a Chinese address or if returns are freepost?

Several items never have showed up.

Terrible customer service experience,"I would strongly advise against shopping with Shein, although they do sell some affordable items. If you do choose to buy from them, be warned: should your parcel get mishandled, do not expect top-notch customer service. Shein's staff seem indifferent and unhelpful, providing nothing more than an automated response that your parcel has been delivered according to their system.

Despite providing proof from the delivery service that my parcels have been lost, Shein persists in referencing their system, which inaccurately shows the parcels as delivered. They consistently ignore my requests to escalate the issue or raise a formal complaint.

This has happened to me not once, but seven times in a row. I've lost hundreds of pounds worth of items, and each time, Shein has refused to take any action or provide any assistance. Though their prices are low, you might end up losing much more due to their unwillingness to help. Their service is truly terrible.","Terrible customer service experience I would strongly advise against shopping with Shein, although they do sell some affordable items.

"Absolutely horrible, reviews are lies","Absolutely horrible. They have the worse customer service, they have absolutely zero common sense.

But nope, I had to trust the word from the ""warehouse"". After thousands in patronage, they wouldn't even do a courtesy $5.48 refund lol. So, I disputed it with my FI, return label, weight of package all the info. I got my $ back from the Shein thieves. It cost them way more in time and process to just give me my refund in due. After that ordeal, they blocked my account from making reviews lol. All the reviews are ""paid"" for anyways. You get points when you review. And any review on returned items or anything too negative that violates their ""rules"" is removed.

larger. I did refund it, and they asked me to print the label and must be
in the original package which is impossible as I don't have the tools to
take out the air out from the mattress and make it small and tied. I have
messaged the seller and Shein to solve the return issue and no one

10 days to level up, unfortunately, from corners 4 inches to 5in. From
the middle 8 to 9 inches and other spots 7in to 8 inches as shown in the

consequences for our back as the mattress is not leveled. This mattress
should not be for sale and not listed in Shein in the first place because
it hurts the website reputation. Again I am asking Shein to please solve my refund issue.

I am extremely disappointed with Shein,"I am extremely disappointed with my recent experience with Shein. I placed an order that was supposed to be delivered to me, but unfortunately, SpeedX, the shipping service they used, acknowledged that my package was delivered to the wrong address. Despite this confirmation from SpeedX, Shein has refused to process a refund or provide any compensation for the lost order. This lack of accountability is frustrating, and I expected better customer service. I hope they will reconsider their policies regarding lost packages and take responsibility for their shipping partners' mistakes. Until then, I cannot recommend shopping with Shein.","I am extremely disappointed with Shein I am extremely disappointed with my recent experience with Shein.

Shein- overall service let down,"I have bought more than $900+ of stuff from Shein. Overall felt like scam and product quality is you get what you pay for. What I have found over time-
Coupons- could not use my active coupons because at checkout the coupons got deactivated, and I was forced to breakdown my order of marketplace vs non products and I paid $450 in 3 checkout’s which did not let me use my 10% coupon in second and third checkout. My coupons got activated again next day after placing all my orders

Games- always hang up on $0.01 to qualify for special savings even after inviting so many people. Basically you rarely get that $500 savings scheme even after inviting friends/family and they never tell you that your invited members also have to invite ppl for you to qualify.

Shipping- the coupon of free shipping beyond $0.01 did not work in second and third payment on same day order placement

Delays- even with express shipping the orders are delayed in every single checkout I have made so far. It now shows 1-2 weeks extra than the express commitment when I had checked out.

Points- you spend weeks in saving those points to buy something special and they take away 30-80 points in a click. Every day check in gives you 5 points, imagine the frustration here as a daily checkin user from 3 years now.","Shein- overall service let down I have bought more than $900+ of stuff from Shein.

If I could give SHEIN zero stars I would,"If I could give SHEIN zero stars, I would. Dealing with them has been an absolute nightmare, and I wouldn’t recommend this company to anyone.

My parcel never arrived, and instead of resolving the issue, SHEIN made it impossible to get any real help. Trying to get on a chat with their customer service feels like trying to crack a secret code—it’s frustrating, time-consuming, and downright infuriating. When I finally got through, their replies were useless, robotic, and repetitive, like a broken record that solves nothing.

Despite this being clearly the carrier’s fault, SHEIN has avoided taking any accountability whatsoever. It’s been over 10 days of back-and-forth, and they still refuse to issue me a refund or send a replacement. Instead, they told me to contact Royal Mail myself—as if it’s my job to clean up their logistical failures. Newsflash, SHEIN: I’m your customer, not your employee or problem solver!

This company has no respect for its customers, no concept of responsibility, and no willingness to fix their mistakes. It’s absolutely appalling. If you want to save yourself from stress, frustration, and losing your money, steer clear of SHEIN.

Apology to Shein,"I'm woman enough to write this apology here, publicly to Shein. I realized today who the real problem was of the ongoing delivery issues, USPS. They posted a fake notice on the tracking page claiming the package had been 'Delivered to agent'. Nobody no what this mean exactly for the customer, but I do. It's a easy scam played on customers to make them think that their package is lost, delayed. Nothing can be further from the truth. My instinct told me to go to the postal annex. Guess what was their when I arrived? My package sitting in the back somewhere. Why tell the easy lie that the package is supposedly ' Delivered to agent....when my package had been at postal annex all day. I keep telling folk something is seriously wrong with these people. Shein you get 2 thumbs up from me...you need to chose another carrier beside USPS or I might have to close my account.","Apology to Shein I'm woman enough to write this apology here, publicly to Shein.

Nobody no what this mean exactly for the customer, but I do. It's a easy scam played on customers to make them think that their package is lost, delayed. Nothing can be further from the truth. My instinct told me to go to the postal annex. Guess what was their when I arrived? My package sitting in the back somewhere. Why tell the easy lie that the package is supposedly ' Delivered to agent....when my package had been at postal annex all day. I keep telling folk something is seriously wrong with these people.

SHOCKINGLY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND…,"SHOCKINGLY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND LACK OF ACCOUTABILITY
I am writing this review as a deeply disappointed and frustrated SHEIN customer. Having been a loyal supporter of this platform, regularly making purchases and actively participating in their promotions, I had come to trust the convenience and affordability SHEIN offers. However, my recent experience has left me questioning whether this brand truly values its customers.

The issue began when a large order of mine was marked as ""delivered,"" even though I had not received it. Naturally, I reached out to SHEIN’s customer service team to resolve the matter, expecting prompt and professional assistance. Unfortunately, the responses I received were dismissive and placed the burden entirely on me to investigate the whereabouts of the package. Instead of taking accountability for the error, they relied on their system’s incorrect status and left me to deal with the fallout.

For several days, I had to repeatedly follow up with SHEIN’s support team, only to receive vague and unhelpful responses. There was a complete lack of urgency or proactive effort to resolve the situation. After enduring this unreasonable delay, the package was eventually left on my doorstep—a full week after the original delivery date. No prior notification was given, and no explanation was provided for the delay. Even worse, there was no effort to ensure the package was securely handed over to me.

Adding to my frustration, SHEIN has yet to acknowledge the stress and inconvenience caused by this ordeal. I received no apology, no compensation, and no reassurance that steps are being taken to prevent similar incidents in the future. This complete lack of empathy is unacceptable, especially given the magnitude of the issue.

To make matters worse, my WhatsApp account was temporarily suspended after being flagged for spam due to my active participation in sharing SHEIN’s promotional links. As someone who has gone out of their way to support the brand, this was an additional insult. I reached out to SHEIN to explain the situation and request compensation for the trouble I endured. Yet, my concerns were either ignored or brushed aside, leaving me feeling undervalued and disregarded as a customer.

This experience has highlighted several troubling aspects of SHEIN’s service. Their delivery process is unreliable, their customer service is dismissive and unhelpful, and their communication with customers is practically non-existent. While their prices may be attractive, this incident has made it clear that SHEIN does not prioritize customer satisfaction or loyalty.

I am sharing this review as a warning to others. If you choose to shop with SHEIN, be prepared for the possibility of unresponsive service and unresolved issues. I sincerely hope the company takes this feedback seriously and implements meaningful changes to improve their processes. However, based on my experience, I will not be returning as a customer anytime soon.

UPDATE: NONCHALANT RESPONSE FROM SHEIN
Following my detailed review outlining the numerous issues I experienced with SHEIN's customer service and delivery process, I was disheartened to receive a generic and dismissive response. Rather than addressing the specific concerns I raised—including their failure to take accountability, the stress caused by their delays, and the lack of compensation or apology—SHEIN simply provided a canned reply directing me to their customer service chatbot and app.

This response only reinforces my belief that SHEIN is unwilling to engage meaningfully with its customers or take responsibility for their failings. If they had taken the time to properly read my review, they would know that I’ve already been through their frustrating and ineffective customer service process multiple times without resolution.

The lack of effort to address the core issues raised in my review is deeply disappointing and speaks volumes about how SHEIN views its customers. To anyone considering shopping with them, please be aware of their unwillingness to resolve serious issues or treat loyal customers with the respect they deserve.","SHOCKINGLY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND… SHOCKINGLY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND LACK OF ACCOUTABILITY

Devastated to Find My Stolen Art on Shein,"I’m an artist who runs a small Etsy shop, pouring countless hours into creating unique and original designs. Imagine my shock when a customer told me that they discovered a listing on Shein selling my stolen work without my permission. After visiting the site, I found numerous listings and sellers profiting off my stolen work.

I contacted Shein but the listings are still up despite my report. As a small business owner, I rely on my art to support my family, and seeing it taken without consent feels like a slap in the face.

Shein’s inaction is infuriating. Artists like me don't have the resources to battle big corporations or endless copyright infringements. It’s disheartening to see such a massive company allow stolen designs to remain on their platform, disregarding the original creators who are harmed.

If you care about supporting independent artists, please think twice before purchasing from platforms like Shein. Behind those low prices are stolen designs and the exploitation of hard-working creatives.","Devastated to Find My Stolen Art on Shein I’m an artist who runs a small Etsy shop, pouring countless hours into creating unique and original designs.

Crap place to order online,"am completely disappointed in this company.

I ordered a damn telescope 5 days ago. And you guys are only telling me now that you don't have in stock.

Firstly I had to wait five bloody days for a damn refund. I do not accept this. I am making a complaint as no one has emailed me withing those days to alert me when it was out of stock and secondly you need better employees because as a staff member you should know it's not in stock before I buy it. And I had bought these items it said there was five left now your telling me it's out of stock..

This is ridiculous and I don't want an apology as you can't even send a telescope correctly.

I didn't even get an option to exchange my items, which normally some places do. A straight refund.

And thirdly because of your stupid actions I cannot get another telescope again. It was my dream as a kid to gather one and you guys ruined it and didn't even communicate to tell me it was out of stock. Very disappointing.

As a customer I am puting a very bad review on Google as to how terrible your service was.

I'm very upset at the fact that I really wanted it and only now your telling me it's out of stock.

I will never shop for shein again this is my complaint and the items I have purchased will be the last items I will purchase at shein

"Shein's horrible ""customer service'","I have been buying a lot of things from Shein lately and other than a small percentage of things coming in broken, I have liked it. But, I am furious at their impossible so-called customer service. Fed-Ex delivered a Shein package to me yesterday that had obviously been opened and re-taped. Several items were missing and I need to do a live chat with Shein because doing a one-at-a-time claim would take forever and is ridiculous. I have found it impossible to do so. Why don't these people have a phone number? I am just about mad enough now to quit buying from them. UPDATE: I just read Shein's reply to me. What utter nonsense! I had already tried what they said to do(multiple times) and gotten nowhere. How come Shein has the human manpower to stalk review forums and reply but not to help me with the fact I got screwed out of several items I paid for?

I have tried all day to contact SheIn and I cannot. The instructions THEY listed below don't work. As soon as I try to type in my message, Shein's damned robot interrupts and asks if I am trying to inquire about some other item that has nothing to do with my situation. This is shameful and is definitely going to impact my willingness to remain a customer. A company that refuses to offer meaningful customer service is a company who has no respect or appreciation for it's customers.","Shein's horrible ""customer service' I have been buying a lot of things from Shein lately and other than a small percentage of things coming in broken, I have liked it. But, I am furious at their impossible so-called customer service. Fed-Ex delivered a Shein package to me yesterday that had obviously been opened and re-taped. Several items were missing and I need to do a live chat with Shein because doing a one-at-a-time claim would take forever and is ridiculous. I have found it impossible to do so. Why don't these people have a phone number? I am just about mad enough now to quit buying from them. UPDATE: I just read Shein's reply to me. What utter nonsense! I had already tried what they said to do(multiple times) and gotten nowhere.

SHEIN SUCKS,"I’ve had such a terrible experience with SHEIN customer support as a whole. I’ve been a loyal customer for over five years and recently I ordered a few things and a few of my items got delivered to the wrong address I contacted customer support because it was marked delivered however I didn’t receive it and I had them verify which address I have on file to have it delivered to. They confirm that the address was right and I did receive a few of my other items so to write their wrong they could have just issued a refund for the things that I didn’t receive and now someone else has it at their residence . this is not on the customer. This is on the company to make right. They kept ending the chat without warning and giving me some BS about. They will “investigate” it. Well, now it’s been almost a week and nothing has happened. They keep dismissing me and as cheap as their stuff is, they should be quick to issue a refund. It was very unprofessional. I don’t recommend using the chat feature if you’re needing assistance as most of them are incompetent and don’t care about actually helping resolve an issue Not to mention my personal information is on that package so I now feel invaded.
Instead of sticking around for them to tell me some BS about how they won’t issue a refund I’m deciding to not support them anymore and I am deactivating my account. TEMU is much better. Don’t shop at shein there cheap and trash customer service skills. Terrible work ethic the way they treat a customer.","SHEIN SUCKS I’ve had such a terrible experience with SHEIN customer support as a whole.

avoid like the plauge,"So, you make an order, you pay for it, they clearly tell you. yes you paid - then they put it on hold for 'varification'. This is where they ask you to send them proof you paid. Despite it CLEARLY saying it has been paid for on the 'my accounts' section and the so-called customer service team agreeing you have paid for it.

What proof do they want - a screen shot of the transaction from your bank. But this is apparently done to 'enhance the shopping experiance' (thier words) Sorry but this has made the shopping experience beyond ghastly.

The screen shot sent and naturally you want to know if it it what they want, customer disservice can't - or won't tell you they just spout corporate twaddle about it being done to 'make you feel a valued customer' sorry but providing proof I have paid when you tell me you know I have does not make me feel valued.

After some reserch this policy may be (I can't say for definate) in breach of section 2 of the Consumer rights act 2015.

i.e. a term is unfair if, contrary to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties' rights and obligations under the contract to the detriment of the consumer.

The contract is complete when the money left my account and went into Shein's - this asking for further proof puts more obligations onto the consumer hence causes an imbalance and tries to change the contract after compleation so may breach this part of the act.

and

The Act also adds to the so-called 'grey list' that lists a non-exhaustive range of terms which are, in most cases, likely to be considered unfair by the courts.

These include:

Allowing the trader to make decisions about the characteristics of the subject matter after the contract had been concluded.

The contract of sale is complete when I paid for the items changing it and asking for proof I paid when they already acknowledge I have paid looks like it may breach this part of the act.

EDIT:

The stock reply is an insult and the customer service online never have the information we want as it is always 'up to a different department'. I have now been give two different reasons why the order was auto cancelled and neither are true. I uploaded exactly the info they wanted and uploaded it well within the 3 days they asked for it.","avoid like the plauge So, you make an order, you pay for it, they clearly tell you. yes you paid - then they put it on hold for 'varification'.

Absolutely disgusted to be lied to…,"Absolutely disgusted to be lied to blatantly! Ordered a £36 jacket, needed to return but return was only showing a very small amount for refund and a suggestion to keep the jacket. Spoke to customer service to query this and was asked why I was returning. The colour didn't suit me and I actually intended to order a different colour so THEY suggested doing an exchange instead. I did this, have it all in writing from 3 different customer service reps including on fb to wait for the return to get to them and they would issue the new one, only to discover that they have done the partial refund and are claiming the other colour is out of stock. It isn't out of stock at all as I have it in my basket! You done me dirty Shein 🤬 I spend way too much on your site but I think I will be going to give temu a try or go back to amazon. May be more expensive but at least they honour their word!
Either send me the exchange jacket as agreed (I will be happy to return the amount you already refunded), refund me the missing £22.22 or return the original jacket to me, as I stated several times I would have kept it if customer service hadn't suggested the exchange! I am currently recovering from cancer and so unable to work and without that voucher I would not have been able to afford to treat myself to an expensive jacket. THAT is why I am so upset! I now have no jacket and no money to buy another 🥺 Had this been said from the beginning I would have kept the original and sold it in order to afford the different colour.
ABOVE ALL DO NOT LIE TO YOUR CUSTOMERS!!! I have since been told that the partial refund is because I used a money off voucher on that particular order, but I specifically asked what the problem was right at the beginning when I queried the minimal refund and your customer services told me they didn't know and not to worry about it and go ahead and send it back. As soon as the parcel was in transit the very next day I was told the exchange wouldn't be done🤬 Then I was told it would be honoured and now this lousy lie about it being out of stock to try to cover yourselves.
Either sort it and keep me as a customer or keep the £22 (how nice to know my value as a customer is just £22 😨) and I will contact PayPal and/or my credit card company for the refund because I am absolutely enraged, not so much at the money but at the lies!!","Absolutely disgusted to be lied to… Absolutely disgusted to be lied to blatantly!

Scammed by Shein,"My order with Shein was placed and I paid via Klarna. Shein used Evri as a delivery service and they notified me that my box had been delivered and sent a picture of it outside my front door. When I got home it wasn't there.

Did a live chat with them and they said I'd have to get a hold put on the next payments and they would have to investigate. Two separate disputes were done and each time Shein took ages to reply to them and eventually told them, delivery had been completed. Klarna have said there is nothing further they can do as Shein have said delivery complete. I go back to Shein who now say I'm out of time for them to do anything.

Order #GSONPG06S001GNN,"Placed an order on the 7th December the parcel was marked as delivered on the 18th December and was left at the door by EVRI without my request.
When arrived home the parcel was simply missing I checked with all my neighbours and none of them said having or seeing the parcel something that never happened before as I am leaving on this flat for over 3 years now and receiving parcels almost every week.
I contacted SHEIN straight after who gave me an automatic response and simply marked as solved ,the problem was still on.
A 2nd ticket has been opened and same response and marked as closed and same happened with the 3rd ticket I opened.
Still without a solution from EVRI and SHEIN and I had to escalate it to KLARNA who is the point of payment.
As a regular customer I must say that this is such a disappointment, not having this solved makes me not trust SHEIN and stop ordering and recommend for sure as they do not show care for their customers.","Order #GSONPG06S001GNN Placed an order on the 7th December the parcel was marked as delivered on the 18th December and was left at the door by EVRI without my request.

"Wow, really exceeded expectations","Wow, super surprised. One person dismissed them saying poor quality, yet I purchased anyway. I'm now convinced that friend has never brought from Shein in order to comment.

The app is super user friendly. A lot of variety. My delivery came quick and easy. I thought I'd be returning some items due to wrong sizing (first time purchasing through them), poor quality, not as per pictures, yet I was amazed. They all fit perfectly, how did that happen! Yes I took into consideration the clothes measurements yet usually something goes askew until you know the company.

The quality was outstanding, every piece I luved, this never happens. Exceeded expectations.

The downfall - I wanted to test their returns service before ordering my next batch, but ... I don't want to return anything ;-) Oh well, I'll have to order anyways, as I now can't wait.

"Cheap fake items, poor customer service","Order number GSO10S50200N57Q

I bought a number of items from Shein on this order.

The worst part was that some Pokemon cards were purchased for a family member. The photography used on the listing looks real but what you get is badly packaged fakes that look nothing like the listing.

Upon opening the cards you can see they're cheap and badly cut and printed. Pokemon cards are meant to have 10 cards and a barcode card inside. Most packs had only 6-7 badly printed cards that are thin and cheap. Plus the cards inside the packs aren't even correct! For instance you'll have fake sword and shield inside a pack that says scarlet and violet. Many packs are just a mix of random series.

I reported this to Shein and they have accepted a return but I have to cover the return cost! Plus the fake listings are still available on their site. The worst is the threat from Shein of them not refunding you if the items aren't returned in the same condition! Of course they're not in the same condition as you sent them, I had to open them to find out they were fake and to take pictures because you wanted an actual picture of the fake item.

My further issue is that Shein are impossible to get in touch with. Ticket and chat ask too many questions so you just get refused any sort of contact from anyone.

Worse still a further order was placed which included more cards as we believed the cards were genuine as shown in the photos.

Order number:GSO10H50U00NB39

I've tried to cancel this order but Shein won't even allow me contact with them as the order hasn't arrived yet and won't arrive for over a week! So, I'm going to be stuck with more fakes that I'll have to return and pay to return at that.

Trading standards need to get involved with Shein as I thought selling fakes was illegal! Worst still they are using Royal Mail to deliver so this surely comes under some sort of mail fraud.

With reference to reply from Shein...

Thanks for the copy and paste reply! I've explained the difficulties in trying to contact your company regarding the fake cards but there's no reply to tickets. Chat and your bot just keep running me around in circles by not answering the question but then asking if I have another question. The issue is that your chat bot has minimal understanding and can only give the same half a dozen answers.

It's clear that you're aware you sell fakes but don't care as long as you get your %

The only option that works is to return the item and get charged for postage even if the items are faulty, fake or not as described. For genuine issues returns should be free.

Also ...

If you actually bothered to read the review left you'll see the order numbers are listed so as you can take action! But no, that would require a level of customer service beyond what you are delivering!

Update, due to this issue and another dispute where Shein have ignored my emails and failed to refund me over a £131.96 order that never arrived I no longer use this company! AVOID them as there is no customer service! Awful company!

Edit! Further update to edited Shein reply on 30th March 2025...

I've done everything you mentioned! Filled a ticket, sent emails, etc but you still won't reply! The failed delivery by royal mail that they now log as missing / undelivered after an investigation has still not catered a reply from you! Even though you've been dealing with my credit card company you have failed to reply to me! You owe me £131.96 because your carrier failed to deliver and lost the item but you've just ignored me! That's awful customer service and I've now stopped buying from you. So have friends and family after seeing the issues I've had with yourself!

How can you edit your reply but not bother to contact me? It just shows that you have no intention of resolving this issue that has now been going on for over 2 months!","Cheap fake items, poor customer service Order number GSO10S50200N57Q

I reached out to the support team multiple times via live chat and phone calls, but the issue remains unresolved. They claimed the shipment was sent in full. When I contacted the courier company, they confirmed that they delivered the shipment exactly as received from [SHEIN].

This has caused a lot of frustration, and I kindly ask the company to: investigate the issue thoroughly and identify the reason behind this significant shortage. I also request either:

The missing items to be resent to me.
A refund for the value of the missing items.
I look forward to your prompt response and resolution of this matter.","Missing Items and Poor Customer Support I recently placed an order (Order Number: GSH10529A000SNM) with [SHEIN], but unfortunately, my experience has been disappointing.

I was scammed out of money,"I was scammed out of money with them guys. From one of their sellers. I gave an address(my address). It said delivered and signed for. Nothing was delivered to my house. I was home all day and my camera works. I was told to contact the shipping company(fedex) I did. I gave them the tracking number that was given to me. Their response was ""the tracking number does not match the address that was given to them"" I then screen shot the tracking, address all on the same receipt. I contacted Shein, took them a week just to tell me that there is nothing they can do because it says delivered. After they told me to do all that and file report. I even took it a step further to contact the seller directly. Never got a response. My opinion. Leave the chinese overseas company alone. Nothing america can do if you cheated out of money. Contacting shein does nothing. I have followed their process

P.S. you responding to this review in the publics eye, does not show your concern. It does not show that you care. I just want to put it out there to the world. I've done my part. Wish i was allowed screen shots to show our communication with your company","I was scammed out of money I was scammed out of money with them guys. From one of their sellers.

Shein marketplace vendor credit fraud,"I have been purchasing Shein clothing and home textiles for approximately a year. I appreciate it the styles and affordable pricing of the items I received.

I found the clothing to be of decent quality, and true to the images and descriptions on the website. Most of the items were true to size. The fabric was often a lightweight material and would only last a season or two. Home Textiles were usually cheaper materials and smaller than presented on the website.

My issue is that recently a purchase was made through a vendor who posted an item that was significantly lower price then other items of similar design. I purchased this item and it was given a tracking number that was fraudulent, as verified through my local post office. I notified Shein and customer service advised that I had to wait for the process. The vendor refunded the money, however to repurchase the item would been significantly more money.

In researching the vendor, I noted that all of the reviews on the now closed store had the same review,""item not received wrong tracking number"". It seems this vendor sold items at lower prices, put in fraudulent tracking number, and refunded the money once the complaint was made. Why would a vendor do this? To collect payment information and addresses for fraud or worse, to sell my information.

When I brought this to customer service attention, they commented that ""it's a pity"" and that they could not do anything since the money had been refunded. I had contacted them twice before the money had been refunded and they told me to wait.

I had also provided them with screenshots of all of the complaints, and the closed store that I had purchased my item from. They had no response regarding this shady vendor, nor any remedy. Just, you've been refunded (which was part of the scam).

I feel that Shein is complicit in allowing their customers data to be compromised by their Marketplace vendors.

I don't know if a remedy can be reached. But countering accusations of fraud with pad answers from customer service is an insult to your customers. Advocating for your vendors who may be stealing from your customers in your name is not good business.

Well I appreciate it the value that shine offered on its clothing and Home Textiles, I now have to monitor my credit card statements for fraud. I don't know if the trade off is worth it. I will not be doing business with this company going forward and I suggest others take this review into consideration before they do business with this company as well.","Shein marketplace vendor credit fraud I have been purchasing Shein clothing and home textiles for approximately a year.

Going downhill - doesn’t follow uk consumer law.,"BAD QUALITY:
Don’t get me wrong, I know shein is not the best quality & isn’t meant to be, but recently it has gone downhill so much! Charging £20/30 a lounge set where the material is completely different from photos extremely tacky, clearly not designed to be made in clothes.

MISLEADING:
Twice I’ve bought something thinking it was a set because it was advertised as one yet only half of it’s arrived!

NOT FOLLOWING CONSUMER LAW:
I ordered something last week and it arrived with the zip broke on. Yet I got charged to return it which isnt following UK consumer law.

PRICE DIFFERENT TO WHAT WAS ADVERTISED:
I had multiple items in my basket and when I selected them to checkout a tracksuit went from £10 to £14 and top went from £6 to £9? If I unselect them they return to normal price.

FAKES:
They have now have so many fake clothes, perfume ect that simply just aren’t safe as-well as flammable clothes.

Clearly putting profit over any reputation they did have & it’s going downhill fast! I don’t know any business trading in the uk that would get away with half of this.","Going downhill - doesn’t follow uk consumer law. BAD QUALITY:

33 out of 47 items ordered MISSING,"On December 30, 2024, I placed an order with Shein totaling ₱19,697 (PHP) for 47 items. However, when the package arrived, I discovered a significant issue: only 14 items were inside, far fewer than I had ordered. To make matters worse, some of the items I received were not even part of my order. Instead, the package contained second-hand denim skirts and shorts that I never requested.

When the package was delivered, it appeared looser, as captured in a photo taken by the delivery driver. Concerned, I immediately inspected the package and recorded a video as I opened it. The footage clearly shows the discrepancy: of the 47 items I ordered, 33 are missing, leaving only 14 items worth around ₱6,000, which is far less than what I paid.

I promptly contacted Shein’s customer service to report the issue and provided all necessary evidence, including photos and the unboxing video. Initially, their representative, Catherine, claimed that an internal investigation found no issues and insisted that the package had been shipped correctly. She advised me to recheck the package or contact the logistics provider. Despite my repeated clarifications and the evidence I provided, Shein refused to take responsibility for the missing items.

Subsequently, another representative, Rhea, followed up and asked me to confirm the missing items from a list they provided. I promptly confirmed the missing items and once again requested either a refund or for Shein to reship the missing products. I also pointed out an important detail: Shein did not provide any photos of the package at the time of shipment, which could have shown whether it was tampered with during transit.

Unfortunately, Shein’s final response was deeply unsatisfactory. They stated that the package was not missing any goods and repeated their advice to recheck it. This response is incredibly frustrating, as I had already inspected the package thoroughly and presented clear evidence of the discrepancy.

After paying ₱19,697, I feel completely ignored and unfairly treated. Despite following all proper procedures and providing undeniable proof, Shein has failed to address the issue or offer any resolution. I am now left with no choice but to escalate this matter further in hopes of receiving the fair treatment and resolution I deserve.

This experience has caused me significant stress, frustration, and financial loss. I trusted Shein with my hard-earned money, paying ₱19,697, but received far less than what I ordered. Instead of enjoying the 47 items I had carefully chosen, I ended up with only 14 items worth around ₱6,000, along with unrelated second-hand denim skirts and shorts that I never ordered.

The missing items have left me scrambling to find replacements for the products I was expecting, which has disrupted my plans. Additionally, I’ve had to spend a lot of time and energy collecting evidence, contacting Shein’s customer service, and following up repeatedly—only to be met with unsatisfactory responses and denial of responsibility.

Beyond the financial loss, this ordeal has shaken my confidence in online shopping and Shein as a company. It has also caused me emotional distress, as I’ve felt ignored, undervalued, and unfairly treated despite presenting clear evidence and following all proper procedures.

I would like Shein to take full responsibility for the missing items in my order. Specifically, I want Shein to either:

Reship the 33 missing items at no additional cost to me, with proper tracking and packaging evidence, or
Issue a full refund for the missing products.
Additionally, I expect a clear explanation of what went wrong during the shipment process and a genuine effort to prevent such incidents in the future. This resolution would address the financial and emotional distress I’ve experienced and restore my confidence in Shein’s ability to provide reliable service.

If Shein continues to ignore my concerns and fails to resolve this issue, I am left with no choice but to take further action, including:

Filing a formal complaint with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and other relevant consumer protection authorities.
Initiating a dispute or chargeback with my bank or payment provider to recover the amount for the missing items.
Sharing my experience publicly on social media, review platforms, or any other appropriate channels to warn potential buyers.
Consulting legal counsel to explore the possibility of a small claims court filing or other legal remedies, should it become necessary.
I hope to find a satisfactory resolution without resorting to these measures, but I am prepared to pursue them if my concerns remain unaddressed.","33 out of 47 items ordered MISSING On December 30, 2024, I placed an order with Shein totaling ₱19,697 (PHP) for 47 items. However, when the package arrived, I discovered a significant issue: only 14 items were inside, far fewer than I had ordered. To make matters worse, some of the items I received were not even part of my order. Instead, the package contained second-hand denim skirts and shorts that I never requested.

Ordered some art supplies,"Ordered some art supplies. Two items arrived broken, but were non returnable and non refundable. This wasn't clear on the website. There's no good reason these items can't be returned as there are no issues with hygiene. This means that suppliers can send you damaged goods knowing they have your money and you have no recourse. Total waste of money.

Art supplies from here in the past have come dented and damaged before. It's a cheap company selling cheap goods. I don't recommend buying art materials from here. Buy from better companies and spend a bit more and or from the manufacturers directly.

I spend a lot of money on art supplies with far superior companies and was curious to see what the experience would be like with SHEIN. It was trash as expected.

Avoid like the plague.

SHEIN RESPONSE
Thank you for your reply. I already contacted your robot customer services in the way you've described and it says none of the items are returnable. It also says that in my account when I tried to set up a return. I tried to contact a human, but could not via the website. I've thrown the items away as they were unusable. I've written off the money I wasted and won't be ordering from SHEIN again. You sell the cheapest of the cheap and the postage packaging is the bare minimum. I didn't plan to buy art supplies like this regularly. I was just curious to see what the experience would be like and it was terrible as expected. We get what we pay for 99.9999% with art materials. Cheap art equipment is sub standard, performs badly, never last and is a false economy, costing us more in the long run, while giving the worst experience. Art supplies are very special items to those who love to express themselves artistically. The better the product the greater the physical results if we put true effort into what we love. This gives us the highest spiritual reward. That joy is worth spending a lot of money on. Only the best performing, highest quality art products should be bought for this reason and only retailers with the highest standards should be patronised. Even if a person is on a tight budget, there are much better retailers, with competitive prices, good deals and the high standards we need.","Ordered some art supplies Ordered some art supplies.

Trash,"Trash. I ordered and was asked for picture verification of my purchase of which I provided as they emailed me that their fraud department needed verification.

Making sure I removed any pertinent information I then provided that as well. Still not enough. And THEN the next email was suggesting I use something less fraudulent and dependable like PayPal. Seriously? Let me say that I do cybersecurity for a living and if YOUR recommended method is flagging fraudulent activity as you request more “proof” of financial records is a huge red flag. Heads up folks, china has been collecting our info for quite sometime through activities like this so those of you that have ordered “successfully,” keep an eye on your finances and other online activity because you may have just sold your personal info for the price of that $11 shirt.

Excessive Customs and VAT - add 33% to your purchases,"I have been a loyal customer and have made several purchases from Shein in the past. However, my recent experience with an order shipped via Aramex has been disappointing.

The phone numbers provided for Aramex do not work, and it seems there is a disconnect in the details shared regarding the shipping company.
Aramex received my goods, but the customs payment link was sent to an incorrect address, causing unnecessary delays.
Additionally, the lack of transparency regarding customs and VAT charges is concerning. I had to pay 33.4% for customs and VAT, which feels excessive.
I urge Shein to ensure accurate shipping details are provided and to offer better transparency on potential customs and VAT charges during checkout.

SHEIN Stands Behind Fraud Sellers,"UPDATE 1/10/25- Still no refund or resolution as of yet. UPS just confirmed the return delivery cannot be delivered because the return address provided by seller was completely fake. SHEIN is completely stonewalling at this point, being terribly obtuse, and refusing to accept the obvious evidence that it is a fake return address. I have filed a PayPal dispute now because apparently I have to exhaust every resource before SHEIN decides to bother to do the right thing.

UPDATE 1/06/25: I have since filed a BBB report and will be proceeding with an FTC complaint as well to report Shein's questionable conduct.

I purchased a 2-cup measuring cup recently on Shein,
that was bought from a fraudulent seller on Shein. Seller is reselling items purchased from Walmart.com using an account that likely uses a fake name and address, both of which were featured on the return label Shein provided. Shein is facilitating this triangulation fraud and standing behind the disreputable seller who somehow was allowed to provide a return label to me that features an invalid address. As checked on the USPS address look-up tool on its website and also a simple search on Google Maps, the return address the seller provided does not exist. This item will never be shipped back to any warehouse. Shein is completely lying and not all addressing issues with a fraudulent seller. The return will never be delivered and Shein is claiming ,so long as return is never delivered, I will not get a return. The illegitimate is 207 windjammer CT, Atkins, VIRGINIA 24311. This is verifiably not a genuine address. I have reported the fraud to Walmart.com, as the seller is dropshipping from there using a fake alias, and likely claiming non-delivery of items to get refunds on the items they're selling on Shein.","SHEIN Stands Behind Fraud Sellers UPDATE 1/10/25- Still no refund or resolution as of yet.

If I could give zero stars i would. Poor customer service,"** edited to respond to Sheins comment**
I have spoken to your customer service THREE times. No one has done anything to rectify the situation. It was clear from my post that I had already spoken to customer service, too. Don't offer to help if no help is actually provided.

If I could give zero stars, I would.
I have been a long time shopper at shein. Like long enough that i am considered a tier 3 VIP. And up until recently still supported them. For the first time I have had an issue with a shipment. There were missing items from my package. Contacting customer service was unhelpful. I was told I would be credited points to my account to repurchase the missing items. These items totalled about $70. The points i was credited were worth less than $1. Contacted customer service again. They told me to contact the shipping company. Which I have done. With no response.
Shein refuses to resolve the issue.
To top it off their products have went down in quality but huge price increase. They cap the coupons so you can only save a small amount now, where they used to be unlimited. The coupons also aren't nearly as high of a percent off as they used to be.

I can see why loyal customers are dropping off left right and center. Save your money. Shop elsewhere.","If I could give zero stars i would. Poor customer service ** edited to respond to Sheins comment**

Return,"I am writing to express my disappointment regarding my recent order (Order Number: [Insert Order Number]). The shipment was delivered more than 10 days later than the estimated delivery date provided by your company. This delay caused significant inconvenience, as I had already traveled by the time the package arrived.

Most of the items in the order were intended as gifts, which are no longer needed. Upon returning and attempting to process a return, I was informed that the return window had passed. However, the late delivery was entirely due to your service, and I believe it is unfair to penalize me for this.

I kindly request that you make an exception and allow me to return the items for a full refund. I have attached proof of the delayed delivery for your reference. I trust that as a reputable company, you will prioritize customer satisfaction and take appropriate action to resolve this matter.","Return I am writing to express my disappointment regarding my recent order (Order Number: [Insert Order Number]).

"If you don’t get your package, you lose your money","I have been a customer for a long time. For some reason an address for an order I placed was changed in their system. I reached out to them via their “customer service”to let them know of this and they told me there was nothing they could do for me.

The number that they gave me for them was disconnected on top of that the website for the carrier could not find my package because the number provided by Shein does not match anything in their system. I found the chat that you have to use with their customer service to be extremely condescending. Here is one screenshot of it.

"Poor customer service, delivery time not met","I ordered my items at the at the start of the month, saying that they will be delivered around 22nd. Then they changed it to 22-24th, then 24th-26th.

What an absolute joke of company.,"What an absolute joke of company.
I placed an order with SHEIN over a week ago, and since then, the tracking status has been stuck at “out of warehouse.” Yodel, the courier, still states they are waiting for SHEIN to send the parcel. I was promised my order would arrive before New Year’s, yet now I’m being told I have to wait until 5th January 2024—this is absolutely unacceptable.

I’ve contacted customer service multiple times, hoping for clarity or a resolution, but all I get are repetitive, unhelpful responses: “Please wait until 5/1/24.” This lazy, generic approach to customer service shows zero regard for customers. I am deeply disappointed by this complete lack of professionalism and transparency.

Waiting another week for a parcel that should have already arrived is not an option for me. This experience has been nothing but stressful, and I will never be ordering from SHEIN again. If you value timely deliveries, honest communication, and basic customer care, avoid SHEIN at all costs. DO NOT ORDER ITS A SCAM! They take your money and don’t give you the items","What an absolute joke of company. What an absolute joke of company.

Absolutely awful,"Absolutely awful. Send an order back to return and emailed them the USPS receipt as asked. They keep telling me they won't refund my money due to 'invalid return proof'. After going back and forth and sending them screenshots of not only the receipt from the post office but the tracking that proves that it was delivered to them, they send me the photo of a hard copy receipt from the post office and tell me that my receipt doesn't look like that.... And that's because my receipt from the post office was emailed to me and not printed to save paper. I keep trying to explain to them that the post office emails you receipts if you select email and that not everyone gets a paper copy anymore and they won't listen and just keep telling me it's invalid return proof so they don't have to give me my money back.
